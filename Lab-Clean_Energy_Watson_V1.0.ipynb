It can be a useful indicator, but to get to the heart of the matter, we need a time series that is stationary in the mean, thus having no trend in the data. There are various ways of doing that, but they all essentially look at the difference between values, rather than the absolute value. In the case of market data, the usual practice is to work with logged returns, calculated as the natural logarithm of the index today divided by the index yesterday:\n",

    "`ln(Vt/Vt-1)`\n",
    "\n",
    "There are more reasons why the log return is preferable to the percent return (for example the log is normally distributed and additive), but they don't matter much for this work. What matters is to get to a stationary time series.\n",
